Real computer scientists despise the idea of actual hardware. Hardware has limitations, software doesn't. It's a real shame that Turing machines are so poor at I/O.
Real computer scientists don't comment their code. The identifiers are so long they can't afford the disk space.
Real computer scientists don't program in assembler. They don't write in anything less portable than a number two pencil.
Real computer scientists like having a computer on their desk, else how could they read their mail?
Real computer scientists only write specs for languages that might run on future hardware. Nobody trusts them to write specs for anything homo sapiens will ever be able to fit on a single planet.
Real programmers don't bring brown-bag lunches. If the vending machine doesn't sell it, they don't eat it. Vending machines don't sell quiche.
Real programmers don't comment their code. It was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.

Real Programmers don't eat quiche. They eat Twinkies and Szechwan food.
Real programmers don't write in BASIC. Actually, no programmers write in BASIC after reaching puberty.
Real Programmers don't write in FORTRAN. FORTRAN is for pipe stress freaks and crystallography weenies. FORTRAN is for wimp engineers who wear white socks.
Real Programmers don't write in PL/I. PL/I is for programmers who can't decide whether to write in COBOL or FORTRAN.
Real Programmers think better when playing Adventure or Rogue.
Real programs don't eat cache.
Real Programs don't use shared text. Otherwise, how can they use functions for scratch space after they are finished calling them?
Real software engineers work from 9 to 5, because that is the way the job is described in the formal spec. Working late would feel like using an undocumented external procedure.
Real Users are afraid they'll break the machine -- but they're never afraid to break your face.

You can prove anything by mentioning another computer language. :-) -- Larry Wall in <199706242038.NAA29853@wall.org>

I'm sure a mathematician would claim that 0 and 1 are both very interesting numbers. :-) -- Larry Wall in <199707300650.XAA05515@wall.org>
True, it returns "" for false, but "" is an even more interesting number than 0. -- Larry Wall in <199707300650.XAA05515@wall.org>

At many levels, Perl is a "diagonal" language. -- Larry Wall in <199709021854.LAA12794@wall.org>
Part of language design is purturbing the proposed feature in various directions to see how it might generalize in the future. -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
Sometimes we choose the generalization. Sometimes we don't. -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
I wouldn't ever write the full sentence myself, but then, I never use goto either. -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
It's appositival, if it's there. And it doesn't have to be there. And it's really obvious that it's there when it's there. -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
Oh, get ahold of yourself. Nobody's proposing that we parse English. -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
As with all the other proposals, it's basically just a list of words. You can deal with that... :-) -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
I hope I'm not getting so famous that I can't think out load [sic] anymore. -- Larry Wall in <199709032332.QAA21669@wall.org>
It would be possible to optimize some forms of goto, but I haven't bothered. -- Larry Wall in <199709041935.MAA27136@wall.org>
A "goto" in Perl falls into the category of hard things that should be possible, not easy things that should be easy. -- Larry Wall in <199709041935.MAA27136@wall.org>
How do Crays and Alphas handle the POSIX problem? -- Larry Wall in <199709050042.RAA29379@wall.org>
Well, that's more-or-less what I was saying, though obviously addition is a little more cosmic than the bitwise operators. -- Larry Wall in <199709051808.LAA01780@wall.org>
You tell it that it's indicative by appending $!. That's why we made $! such a short variable name, after all. :-) -- Larry Wall in <199709081801.LAA20629@wall.org>
